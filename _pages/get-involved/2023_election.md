### Bursar (Must be a current student) - incumbent is running

The bursar manages incoming revenue from member dues and rentals. The bursar presents at the annual budget meeting to help the club make informed spending decisions. Writes/submits applications to LEF and GSC for funding for Winter School during Nov/Dec of each year. 

### Five (5) Members At Large (At least 1 current student) - only some incumbents running

The 5 Members-at-large make up the remainder of the voting BoD members for purposes of managing the budget, appointing and approving other Advisory Board members, and other executive powers of the club.

## Chair Positions - Can be shared, and may be held by non-students

Formally per the Constitution and Bylaws, all positions beyond the Executive Board are established as needed and appointed by the Executive Board. Practically, there are several positions that are necessary for the club to operate effectively and have continued to exist for a long time, and are traditionally voted on during the elections meeting. The listing here is not exhaustive, members may create new chair positions at any time as new activities become popular within the club. 

### Desk Captain x2 - incumbent not running

Must be an active deskworker, ideally one desk captain is MIT affiliated with an engage account for office access management - former desk captains Janey Farina and Andrea Lehn will help train the new members and be available for questions for as long as needed

Role duties include:
- Helping answer desk related emails (in conjunction with past desk captains, gear managers & activity chairs)
- Running deskworker trainings
- Ensuring office hours are staffed
- Approving office hour desk credit requests
- Managing other desk credit requests, refunds, overpayments, etc
- Reminding renters to return overdue gear
- Helping the gear managers do a gear recall for the anual gear inventory
- Helping with rental logistics for big events like circus and winterschool
- This year only - helping to coordinate moving all gear from the boathouse back to the office in the fall when W20 construction is complete 
- Coordinating ocasional group rentals to specific other student orgs
- Managing office access (MIT affiliation needed)
- Fighting chaos and entropy

The role is mostly administrative, we have lots of wonderful deskworkers and other volunteers who run office hours and help out with inventorying and such. You're never in charge of doing all the work, just coordinating!

### Gear Manager x2 - incumbent not running

- The gear manager’s duties involve:
- Purchasing new equipment
- Planning the annual gear inventory
- Retiring obsolete equipment
- Repairing damaged equipment

The gear manager does not have to do any of this work alone. Many volunteers come out to help with these tasks on a regular basis. The gear manager simply coordinates the repair and inventory sessions.

Josh Bradshaw was the gear manager for the 2022/2023 season. He would like to remain involved for a few months after elections to finish his ongoing projects: 


1) Buying the winter boots that the BOD approved budget for last September (the best discounts are only available mid-summer). 
2) Moving gear back into the office after the student center renovation and rebuilding the shelving.
3) Fixing a few of MITOCs bikes.

Besides these tasks that carry over across the election cycle, Josh wants to cede all of the duties involved in gear management to the new managers. MITOC has a huge amount of gear and things break frustratingly often, so the club could use a lot of help in this area. It would be perfectly fine for the club to have several gear managers working together.

### Intervale Managers  - incumbent running and seeking new trainees

Duties include:
- Administrative work such as paying property taxes
- Granting reservations
- Cabin maintenance
- Managing relationships with neighbors
- Road maintenance
- Managing contractors
- Fundraising and planning for larger projects, such as regrading and resurfacing the road

Josh Bradshaw would like to stay on for the 2023-2024 season but he expects that this will be his final year of cabin management. He is eager to bring on new talent and teach them about all the peculiarities of the cabin. 

While these duties are extensive and potentially overwhelming, there is a large base of volunteers who quite reliably show up to help with these tasks when called upon by the cabin managers. The cabin manager may also defer small ongoing maintenance tasks to members who visit the cabin regularly. 

There can be up to 4 Intervale cabin managers. Ideally seeking at least one MIT student for this role. As of time of writing, there are two serious applications for this position.

Traveling to and from the cabin is expensive. Josh will petition the board of directors to grant a travel subsidy or reimbursement budget for cabin maintenance in the upcoming year. 

### Winterschool Chair x2 - incumbents not running

Must have been an active winterschool leader for at least one winterschool 

### Circus Chair x2 - incumbents not running

The circus chairs coordinate group events at Camelot between April and October. Usually ends up with one every 1-2 months depending on schedules.

Logistics around circuses include:
- Posting trip page on MITOC trips site at least 2 weeks in advance
- Managing dropping participants and adding other folks from the waitlist after the lottery runs (~1 week in advance)
- Pre-trip meeting week of circus
- Monitoring participant payments and sign ups for the weekend
- Monitor rideshare - Assist w/ arranging rental cars if needed
- Coordinating food for breakfast Sat/Sun and dinner Saturday
- Sending follow up emails w/ reminders post circus
- Biggest skills for this involve staying on top of emails / participant list, demonstrating empathy towards new-to-the-outdoors students / people, and confidence / flexibility when sorting hikes + leaders + cars late at night. Aka, lots of competent camp counselor stoke. 

### Camelot Managers - incumbents James, David, Pavel, Blue are running

There are currently 4 Camelot managers, who all intend to remain involved. We are not actively looking for additional managers, but if somebody is super hyped you should reach out to us.

### Mediation Chairs X3 (ideally representing different identities)

Incumbents Taylor Biron and Mike Chan are running again 

The Mediation Committee is MITOC’s way to handle conflicts and concerns that might arise between MITOCers and generally help the club be a safer space to everyone. Previous initiatives spearheaded by the mediation committee include emotional safety training or conflict management classes in partnership with MIT’s own internal training team. The mediation chair should will have to make impartial decisions and should be capable of being compassionate, engaging, and considerate of others to developing resolutions within the MITOC community.

Some more information directly in the words of Chiara:

"Expected workload is quite low.  It is nothing at all most of the time and then if an issue arises then the workload can vary a fair amount.  The nice thing about having two mediation chairs is if one person is busy when something comes up then the other can take point on it.

Generally, we respond to any issues that are reported to us and try to refer them to resources that can help.  If it is something MITOC specific, like a rules thing, etc, then we can either respond directly or form a committee of people to handle the issue (we don’t have to directly handle everything ourselves!).  The latter response is more for if there is something serious.

One point to make is that a big part of this job is getting people to the right resources, rather than adjudicating everything ourselves.  I would also say that it is a great role to have a big impact on people’s experiences in MITOC and improve culture without having to put in a lot of time.”
